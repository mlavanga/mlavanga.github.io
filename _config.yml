  Born in Italy and raised by a medical doctor and a housewife, since his childhood Mario has developed an early interest in human physiology and biology. 
  Doubtful to seek a clinical career, he went on to study Biomedical engineering at Polytechnic university of Milan, where he delved into the intertwined 
  realities of physics and biology. During his studies, he had the opportunity to build a strong background in the field of biomedical signal processing. 
  Furthermore, he joined a top-level students program organized by the two main Italian technical universities, known as Alta Scuola Politecnica (ASP), 
  which provided opportunity to learn a multidisciplinary approach to solving problems. The skills he acquired have been useful in his working experience, which is characterized 
  by frequent interactions with clinical doctors. |
  
  Immediately after graduating, he moved to KU Leuven, Belgium, where he started focusing on mental health and neurodevelopment as part of his PhD studies, under 
  the supervision of <a target = "_blank" href ="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?id=17">Prof. Sabine Van Huffel</a>, <a target = "_blank" href ="https://research-hub.urosario.edu.co/display/alexander-caicedo-dorado">Prof. Alexander Caicedo Dorado</a>, 
  <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.uzleuven.be/en/physicians-and-specialists/gunnar-naulaers">Prof. Gunnar Naulears</a>, <a target = "_blank" href ="https://www.uzleuven.be/en/physicians-and-specialists/els-ortibus">Prof. Els Ortibus</a>. 
  In January 2017, he received a strategic basic research grant from the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.fwo.be/en/news/results/phd-fellowships-and-postdoctoral-fellowships/results-sb-fellowships-call-2016/">Flemish scientific research fund (FWO)</a>. 
  The goal of his research was to quantify stress in premature babies by means of EEG and ECG signal processing and to understand its impact on the infants’ development. |
  
  After its graduation, he moved to Aix-Marseille University, France, for a postdoc position. His new research focuses on the mathematical modelling 
  of the neurodevelopment and ageing based on the Virtual Brain technology by <a target = "_blank" href = "https://ins-amu.fr/jirsaviktor"> Prof. Viktor Jirsa </a>.
  This project is part of the European effort of the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/">Human Brain Project</a>.

          Modelling ageing and neurodevelopment with The Virtual Brain 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The objective of this project is to create a virtual ageing cohort based on the <a target = "_blank" href ="https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-8/EN/Forschung/Projects/1000_Brains_study/1000_Brains_node.html" >1000 brains study </a> dataset. Based on the structural information
          of each of the study participant, the functional activity can be replicated with the whole-brain modelling approach of the <mark><a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei" >Virtual Brain</a></mark>. The ultimate goal
          is to describe the functional trajectory of ageing with in-silico approaches and understand which structural processes occurring in ageing might affect 
          the brain functions and functional networks. The modelling software has been built in <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>JupyterLab</mark>, shared and monitored with <mark>Git</mark> and executed 
          with <mark>SnakeMake</mark> and <mark>Slurm</mark> on hyper-performance computing facilities.

          Modeling early-life and pain in premature infants
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          My PhD research focused on the detection of early-life pain and stress in premature infants by means of physiological signal processing. Patients were 
          monitored at different age during the neonatal intensive care unit stay. A variety of clinical oriented metrics were derived to quantify stress and 
          understand the relationship between physiological instabilities and future development outcomes. The results show that infants with a dysmature EEG in the first days of life 
          might be associated with a greater pain experience, that could potentially lead to a lower development outcome and more internalziing behavior. The project was developed 
          in <mark>Matlab</mark> and the code of the stress detection models along with other automatic development analysis in preemies will soon be 
          available on <mark>GitHub</mark>. This research was supported with the strategic basich research fellowship by the FWO. The PhD thesis manuscript can be download at this <a target = "_blank" href ="https://mlavanga.github.io/documents/LAVANGA_Mario_Thesis_Sep2020.pdf" >link </a>.

          The project aimed to introduce possible solutions for a reliable e-voting system based on <mark>blockchain</mark> techonology. This approach 
          could especially improve the democratic engagement for long-range commuters and citizens living abroad.
