  Born in Italy and raised by a medical doctor and a stay-at-home mom, since his childhood Mario has developed an early interest in human physiology and biology. 
  Doubtful to seek a clinical career, he went on to study Biomedical engineering at Polytechnic university of Milan, where he delved into the intertwined 
  realities of physics and biology. During his studies, he had the opportunity to build a strong background in the field of biomedical signal processing. 
  He also joined a top-level students program organized by the two main Italian technical universities, known as Alta Scuola Politecnica (ASP), 
  which provided opportunities to learn a multidisciplinary approaches to solving problems. The skills he acquired have been useful in his working experience, which is characterized 
  by frequent interactions with clinical doctors. 
  
  Immediately after graduating, he moved to KU Leuven, Belgium, where he started focusing on mental health and neurodevelopment as part of his PhD studies, under 
  the supervision of <a target = "_blank" href ="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?id=17">Prof. Sabine Van Huffel</a>, <a target = "_blank" href ="https://research-hub.urosario.edu.co/display/alexander-caicedo-dorado">Prof. Alexander Caicedo Dorado</a>, 
  <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.uzleuven.be/en/physicians-and-specialists/gunnar-naulaers">Prof. Gunnar Naulears</a> and <a target = "_blank" href ="https://www.uzleuven.be/en/physicians-and-specialists/els-ortibus">Prof. Els Ortibus</a>. 
  In January 2017, he received a strategic basic research grant from the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.fwo.be/en/news/results/phd-fellowships-and-postdoctoral-fellowships/results-sb-fellowships-call-2016/">Flemish scientific research fund (FWO)</a> to quantify stress in premature babies by means of EEG and ECG signal processing and to understand its impact on the infants’ development. |
  
  After its graduation, he moved to Aix-Marseille University, France, for a postdoc position. His new research focuses on the mathematical modelling 
  of neurodevelopment and ageing based on the Virtual Brain technology developed by <a target = "_blank" href = "https://ins-amu.fr/jirsaviktor"> Prof. Viktor Jirsa </a>.
  This project is part of the European effort of the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/">Human Brain Project</a>.

          Modelling ageing and neurodevelopment with The Virtual Brain 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The objective of this project is to create a virtual ageing cohort based on the <a target = "_blank" href ="https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-8/EN/Forschung/Projects/1000_Brains_study/1000_Brains_node.html" >1000 brains study </a> dataset. Based on the structural information
          of each of the study participant, the functional activity can be replicated with the whole-brain modelling approach of the <mark><a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei" >Virtual Brain</a></mark>. The ultimate goal
          is to describe the functional trajectory of ageing with in-silico approaches and understand which structural processes occurring in ageing might affect 
          the brain functions and functional networks. The modelling software has been built in <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>JupyterLab</mark>, shared and monitored with <mark>Git</mark> and executed 
          with <mark>SnakeMake</mark> and <mark>Slurm</mark> on hyper-performance computing facilities.

          Modeling early-life and pain in premature infants
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          My PhD research focused on the detection of early-life pain and stress in premature infants by means of physiological signal processing. Patients were 
          monitored at different age during the neonatal intensive care unit stay. A variety of clinical oriented metrics were derived to quantify stress and 
          understand the relationship between physiological instabilities and future development outcomes. The results show that infants with a dysmature EEG in the first days of life 
          might be associated with a greater pain experience, that could potentially lead to a lower development outcome and more internalziing behavior. The project was developed 
          in <mark>Matlab</mark> and the code of the stress detection models along with other automatic development analysis in preemies will soon be 
          available on <mark>GitHub</mark>. This research was supported with the strategic basich research fellowship by the FWO. The PhD thesis manuscript can be download at this <a target = "_blank" href ="https://mlavanga.github.io/documents/LAVANGA_Mario_Thesis_Sep2020.pdf" >link </a>.

          I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the INS focusing on functional connectivity in the contest
          of healthy ageing. I am part of the theoretical neuroscience group and I work as part of a team dedicated to the resting state 
          brain. I spend most of my time working on <mark>Python</mark> applications in <mark>Jupyter-lab</mark> to compute a variety of 
          biomarkers associated to ageing and reproduce with biophysical models. My team and I are investigating functional connectivity 
          dynamics and static functional connectivity in both the context of pathological and healthy ageing. In parallel, we are deploying
          a variety of computational strategies to tune our models and reproduce the empirical patterns by means of supercomputer facilities.
          
          Thanks to my doctoral studies, I can bring my perspective in the empirical data analysis, especially related to ageing. On top of that,
          I provide specific views to enhance the comprehension of our team's results to the clinical side of the project. I enjoy learning
          <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Jupyter</mark> as tools for scientific computing, as well as the schedule manager such as <mark>Slurm</mark>
          or parallel computing tools such as <mark>SnakeMake</mark>.

          During my years as a SB PhD fellow, I developed a model to quantify stress and pain in premature infants and 
          to understand the physiological processes behind the infants' development. The first part of my research focused on the assessment
          of development inside the neonatal intesive care unit by means of physiological signal processing. I investigated the 
          scalp-EEG connectivity, the nonlinear properties of the neonatal EEG signal and the fractality of the heart-rate
          varaibility of the premature infant in the context of NICU development. The quantification of maturation trends by data processing is usually known 
          as brain-age models. The codes associated to each of these studies were developed in <mark>Matlab</mark>.

          The second part of my PhD was focused on the development of models and metrics to quantify pain and stress in premature infants. 
          Based on the investigation of the development processes in the first of my PhD, I combined the information associated to the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8037246">nonlinear
          properties of EEG</a> and the <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.581250/full">heart-rate variability</a> as well as the <a target = "_blank" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6579/aabac4">interaction among EEG signals</a> and between EEG and heart-rate
          to detect stress or pain in premature infants. These approaches focused on the <a target = "_blank" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6579/ab9b66">resting-state activity</a> as well as the specific phenomenon
          of heart-rate drops, known as <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.00741/full">bradycardias</a>. The outputs of these analysis were combined in an investigation effort to understand
          if the accumulation of pain in the intensive care units might lead any difference in maturation trajectories. The results showed
          greater <a target = "_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/pain/Abstract/9000/The_effect_of_early_procedural_pain_in_preterm.98213.aspx">discontinuity in EEGs</a> were associated to a greater accumulation of pain by preamture infants. The codes associated to each 
          of these studies were developed in <mark>Matlab</mark>.

          My first year as PhD researcher was fully dedicated to the full comprehension of the specific domains of neonatal physiology and development as well as 
          machine learning and graph theory. These tools were necessary to create and design the maturation and stress models for my doctoral studies.
