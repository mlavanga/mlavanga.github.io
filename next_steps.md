# Next steps

1. The picture and the cv is missing on the website. The previous version add documents folder, which I would like to reinstate for my personal records.
2. Remove any reference to twitter, but you tube and google scholar icons.
3. A skills is missing. Analyze the skills section of the old version and adapt it to the new context.
4. A media section is missing. Create one and adapt the video frame from my youtube videos.
5. Remove any reference to `mario.LAVANGA@univ-amu.fr`. Email should always email to `m.lavanga@gmail.com`.
